   abstract = {In classical field theory, gluing spacetime manifolds along boundary corresponds to taking a fiber product of the corresponding spaces of fields (as differential graded Fréchet manifolds) up to homotopy. We construct this homotopy explicitly in several examples in the setting of BV-BFV formalism (Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism with cutting-gluing).},
