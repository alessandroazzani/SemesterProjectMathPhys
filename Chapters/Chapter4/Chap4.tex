\chapter{Gluing via Fiber Products}
\label{chap:gluing}

In classical field theory, gluing spacetime manifolds along boundaries corresponds to taking fiber products of the corresponding spaces of fields, up to homotopy.
In \cite{Gluing_BV-BFV}, the authors construct this homotopy in several examples in the BV-BFV formalism setting.

This chapter will revise their paper, the main results and some of the examples they compute.
