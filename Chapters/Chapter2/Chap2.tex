\chapter[Introduction to Supergeometry]{Introduction to \\ Supergeometry}
\label{chap:intro_supergeom}

Supergeometry is an essential concept in order to understand the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and its adaptation to Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism.

In this chapter, we start with the easier concepts of \emph{graded vector fields} and \emph{superspaces}, before adapting these to the case of manifolds.
We define \emph{supermanifolds} and \emph{graded manifolds} and give some examples.
Finally, we see how to build vector fields on these complicated structures.

Most of the content of this chapter is taken from \cite{Nima} and \cite{Intro_BV-BFV}.
