\chapter{The BV-BFV formalism}
\label{chap:BV-BFV}

In this chapter we will first talk about the need of a new formalism in order to include \emph{gauge theories} when computing Feynman diagrams.
We will then present the cure of this problem, which is the Batalin-Vilkovisky construction.
Finally, we will introduce the definition of a manifold with boundary in the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism.

The whole chapter is mainly based on \cite{Nima}, but it also has some references to \cite{Musio},\cite{Mnfd_boundaries} and \cite{Lectures}.
