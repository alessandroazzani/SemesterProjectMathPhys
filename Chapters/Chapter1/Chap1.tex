\chapter{Preliminaries of Differential Geometry}
\label{chap:diff_geom}

In this chapter we briefly introduce the basic notions needed to understand the foundations of supergeometry, which will lead to the BV-BFV formalism.
In particular, we start by introducing the most important concepts of differential geometry for us, which range from the definition of \emph{tangent space}, to \emph{differential $s$-forms} and \emph{Lie derivative}.
We will then focus on the concept of \emph{de Rham cohomology}, before starting to introduce \emph{symplectic forms} and \emph{vector fields} on manifolds.

We mostly refer to \cite{Nima} for this chapter on the basics of differential geometry.
