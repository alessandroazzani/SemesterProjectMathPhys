\chapter{Preliminaries of Differential Geometry}
\label{chap:diff_geom}

In this chapter we briefly introduce the foundations needed to understand the concept of supermanifolds and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.
\textcolor{red}{Add more details of what it is said in the sections}.
We mostly refer to \cite{Nima} for this chapter on the basics of differential geometry.
